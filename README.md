# two-stage-text-summarization

In our project, we developed a 2-stage model for text summarization. It combines the ability to filter informative sentences of the extractive approach with the ability to paraphrase of the abstractive approach. 

Our best model achieves a ROUGE-L F1 score of 39.82, which outperforms the strong baseline.
